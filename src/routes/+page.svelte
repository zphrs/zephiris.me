	My name is <Zephiris />. I am a full stack programmer currently studying @ UCSC. My old name is
	<span class="masc gilbert">Zephyr</span>: a name which I quite liked. That said, I wanted a name
	that had less of a strictly <span class="masc"> masculine connotation</span>. Rather, I wanted a
	name which mixed masculinity and femininity as I am <span class="andro">nonbinary</span>.
</p>

<p>
	In greek mythology the Greek god <span class="masc gilbert">Zephyr</span>, god of the west wind,
	is married to
	<span class="fem gilbert">Iris</span>, the Greek goddess of rainbows. I decided to sandwich the
	two names together to get <Zephiris />.
</p>
<p>
	The name can also be broken down into three nicknames depending on if you think my vibe at any
	given moment is more <span class="masc">masculine</span>, <span class="fem">feminine</span>, or
	<span class="andro">androgynous</span>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span class="masc gilbert">Zeph</span>
		<span class="agender"> - for when I seem more masculine</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fem gilbert">Iris</span>
		<span class="agender"> - for when I seem more feminine</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="andro gilbert">Phire</span>
		<span class="agender"> - for when I seem more androgynous. (pronounced like ðŸ”¥)</span>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	All three are equally correct, so use whichever one you find fits me best in the moment. Of course
	you can also call me by my full name, <Zephiris />, too.
